*Iliad*

Implementation of Logical Inference for Adaptive Devices

    Rage—Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,<br/>
    murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,<br/>
    hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,<br/>
    great fighters’ souls, but made their bodies carrion,<br/>
    feasts for the dogs and birds,<br/>
    and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end.<br/>
    Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed,<br/>
    Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles.<br/><br/>

*Iliad*, the *Implementation of Logical Inference for Adaptive
Devices* is the infrastructure for the *Poem* implementation.  The
first parts that will be implemented will be a theorem prover (or, if
you prefer, an extended Prolog interpreter) based on PTTP and a
situation-calculus based language that utilizes PTTP for inference.

*PTTPP*—The Prolog Technology Theorem Prover for Poem
------------------------------------------------------

  <i>
    And the one who proves the better man and wins,<br/>
    he’ll take those treasures fairly, lead the woman home.<br/><br/>
  </i>
  —Homer. The Iliad.
</p>

*PTTPP* is the *Prolog Technology Theorem Prover for Poem*, based on
PTTP, the Prolog Technology Theorem Prover, originally conceived and
implemented by Mark Stickel at SRI.  We base the implementation of
Poem on this technology since it offers a sound and complete inference
engine with high inference rates.

The Workflow for the *Poem* Project
-----------------------------------

  <i>
    The work done, the feast laid out, they ate well<br/>
    and no man’s hunger lacked a share of the banquet.<br/><br/>
  </i>
  —Homer. The Iliad.

I am currently experimenting with the git-flow branching model for
*Poem*.  Please see the article "[A successful Git branching
model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)" for
details.

    No one should ever let such nonsense pass his lips,<br/>

All quotes from the Iliad are taken from the Penguin Classics edition
translated by Robert Fagles.  The HTML markup for the quotes uses the
old-fashioned ```align="right"``` style, since CSS does currently not
seem to work for the Github renderer.
